This is a basic portfolio website built using HTML and CSS.
It contains two pages:

Home Page â€“ Introduces me and highlights my skills.

Contact Page â€“ Provides details to get in touch.

The design is simple, clean, and responsive, showcasing my understanding of basic web development concepts like semantic HTML and CSS styling.
This project serves as a starting point for my web development journey and demonstrates my ability to create a functional personal portfolio from scratch.
